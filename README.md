# JTCAM-11178-AndreNous-ARXmodelsforLinearViscoElasticity
Code source for computations presented in JTCAM11178 paper
These matlab scripts have been written under version R2020b (9.9.0.1467703).
The script entitled ExecutablePaper_JTCAM#11178_AndreNous.mlx is a livescript
(equivalent of Jupyter Notebook in Python). When launched, it produces
an executive and executable version of the published paper in Journal of Theoretical Computational
and Applied Mechanics (2023). 
It is a companion version of this article and offers the reader
a comprehensive access to the ideas there discussed through the code lines available
to reproduce (some of) the computations and plotted figures on which it relies.
The scripts invlap.m and mlf.m respectively performing numerical matlab inversion through De Hoog's algorithm
and numerical evaluation of the Mittag-Leffler functions have been collected from the matlab central file exchange platform.
The script basically reproduces the computations of section 4.3.2 but can be extended from that point
by researchers aiming at developing specific computations for different viscoelastic behavior's laws.
Stéphane André and Camille Noûs, June 2023.

Camille Noûs is the name of a collective author raised as symbolic scientific personality, who signs research publications as a co-author, claims the collaborative and open nature of knowledge creation, appraisal and dissemination, under the control of the academic community, and is intended to become a label of integrity[1]. Camille Noûs is a member of the Cogitamus laboratory, which is multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary in essence.
Camille’s contributions to the advancement of knowledge encompass both the before of a publication (state-of-the-art, position of problems, methodology) and their after (collegial controversy, follow-up on results over a long period of time). Camille Noûs is also a member of editorial boards, has launched calls for papers and co-signed several texts in defence of the scientific institution.
